# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Analysis of Kisckstarter funding campaign with the following focus/criteria:
- Filtered for "Theater" campaigns
- Outcomes based on "Launch date" and "Funding Goal"

### Purpose

  The purpose of this endeavor was to assist our client, Louise, to determine if there seemed to be any correlation between successful/unsuccesful Kickstarter campaigns in the **Theater** category. We looked at two outcomes per her request: Campaign ***Launch date*** and ***funding goal***.
  
  Louise will use this information to help guide her in planning a funding campaign for her play *Fever*.
